# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## Overview
This project uses employee data to analyze why employees leave a company and to predict attrition using machine learning. It helps in understanding important factors that affect employee retention and supports better HR decision making.

## Tools and Technologies
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## File Description
- Employee_Attrition.ipynb  
  Contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and prediction.

## Workflow

1. Data Loading  
   The employee dataset is loaded and basic information is studied.

2. Data Cleaning  
   Missing values are handled and the data is prepared for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis  
   Important patterns and relationships in the data are visualized.

4. Feature Selection  
   Relevant features are selected for building the model.

5. Model Building  
   A machine learning classification model is trained to predict employee attrition.

6. Model Evaluation  
   The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and other metrics.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Install Python and Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open the file `Employee_Attrition.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all the cells to see the analysis and predictions.

## Conclusion
This project shows how machine learning can be applied to HR data to predict employee attrition and help organizations take data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.
